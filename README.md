# Naresh-Ai-voice-assistant
This project aims to develop an AI-powered voice assistant that can 
understand spoken commands and perform a variety of tasks, such as answering 
questions, managing schedules, setting reminders, playing music, and 
interacting with smart home devices. The system integrates speech-to-text 
(STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) modules, alongside NLP algorithms, to offer 
real-time assistance. Additionally, it utilizes APIs to provide dynamic 
information like weather updates, news, and more. 
AI voice assistants are software applications powered by artificial 
intelligence that allow users to interact with digital systems through spoken 
language. These assistants process voice commands, recognize speech patterns, 
and respond by providing relevant information or executing tasks. With 
advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Automatic Speech 
Recognition (ASR), voice assistants have evolved from simple query-response 
systems into versatile tools integrated into smartphones, smart speakers, and 
home automation systems
